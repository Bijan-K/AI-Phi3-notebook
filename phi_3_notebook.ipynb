Likelihood of ECB rate cuts grows, with potential implementation as early as June. Invest like the big funds from the comfort of your home with our AI-powered ProPicks stock selection tool. Learn more here>> There's no remnant of April's widespread corrective movement on the major US and European indices in sight anymore.  Optimism from the demand side stemmed from Wednesday's US inflation data, aligning with market expectations yet breaking a streak of five consecutive readings above forecasts. It's noteworthy how the market decisively moved without any surprises, reflecting bullish determination to sustain the upward trajectory.  Concurrently, the prospect of the ECB outpacing its overseas counterpart in initiating a series of interest rate cuts is gaining traction.  A series of dovish remarks from European Central Bank officials, particularly Francois Villeroy de Galhau and Mario Centeno, hints at groundwork for a potential 25 basis points cut as early as June.  Let's take a look at three of the most important global indexes to assess their key trading levels at the moment.  S&P 500 Eyeing New All-Time Highs with a Target of at Least 5400 Points This week, the S&P 500 breached new historical highs, albeit marginally. Nevertheless, bullish sentiment suggests an appetite for considerably higher levels, implying a potential continuation of the upward trend with a target near the next significant level of 5400 points.\" # @param {type:\"string\"}"
